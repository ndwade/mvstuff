A focussed set of primitives to shove large quantities of files in random directory structures
into a single, managed directory, eliminating duplicates, and preserving time order.

Appropriate for "stuff" which is non-critical but which is worth hanging on to.

Rather than create an all singing, all dancing utility with lots of options, a set of 
methods is exposed in a package object which may be used to construct interpreted scala scripts 
for specific purposes.
